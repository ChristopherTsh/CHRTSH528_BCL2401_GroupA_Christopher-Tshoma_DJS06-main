JavaScript Array Manipulation and Filtering
This script demonstrates various techniques for manipulating and filtering arrays in JavaScript, including:

Logging array elements
Transforming elements using map
Sorting elements
Filtering elements using filter
Creating an object mapping using reduce
Advanced exercises for further practice
Arrays
The following arrays are used in the script:

provinces: A list of provinces in South Africa
names: A list of names
products: A list of products with prices
Basic Manipulation
The script logs each name, province, and name with matching province. It also transforms the provinces array to uppercase and logs the length of each name.

Sorting
The script sorts the provinces array alphabetically.

Filtering
The script filters the provinces array to remove provinces containing "Cape" and logs the remaining count. It also creates a boolean array indicating whether each name contains the letter "S".

Creating Object Mapping
The script uses reduce to transform the names array into an object mapping names to their respective provinces.

Advanced Exercises
The script includes several advanced exercises for further practice:

Filtering out products with names longer than 5 characters
Filtering out products without prices, converting string prices to numbers, and calculating the total price using reduce
Concatenating all product names into a single string using reduce
Identifying the highest and lowest-priced items and returning a string formatted as "Highest: X. Lowest: Y."
Transforming the products array into an object mapping product names to their respective prices using reduce
Usage
To run the script, copy and paste the code into a JavaScript file and run it using a JavaScript engine. The script will log the results to the console.
